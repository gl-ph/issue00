            <p>With digital literature, the virtual line between maker and consumer gets a bit squiggly. Interactivity rules are the rules. Works like Rui Torres's kinetic poem <a href="http://collection.eliterature.org/2/works/torres_poemas_caminho.html">"Poemas no meio do caminho"</a> and locative narratives such as <i><a href="http://www.thesilenthistory.com/">The Silent History</a></i> by Eli Horowitz, Kevin Moffett, Matthew Derby, and Russell Quinn invite and incorporate user input into the always-refreshing work. In this spirit, and especially in the spirit of works like Nick Montfort's <i><a href="https://nickm.com/poems/taroko_gorge.html">Taroko Gorge</a></i>, where makers are encouraged to reuse and recycle code to produce their own digital literature, gl-ph has built a Maker's Playground, where we make a work of digital literature  available for download, reconfiguration, deformation and reupload. Enjoy!</p>
